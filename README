# PitchWise

PitchWise is an interactive tool to visualize matchup-specific maximally
exploitative strategies for both batters and pitchers by count.  Based on a series of machine learning models, it uses physical characteristics of a pitch along with latent player and ballpark embeddings to predict the distribution of outcomes of a pitch.  The Shiny app and data in this repository represent a publicly available demo version of this tool, consisting of two pitchers and two batters from the Cleveland Indians.  Each matchup is assumed to take place at the end of the 2017 season.

## Instructions
1) Download the repository and set it as your working directory.
2) Make sure that you have installed the [Shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny) and [Tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse) R packages.
3) If you are using the R console, run `runApp("app_demo.R")`.  If you are using RStudio, click on the **Run App** button at the top right of the editor.
